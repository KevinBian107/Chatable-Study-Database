## A "Chatable" Study Database ðŸ’¬
Data in practice, manually collected data and this is a repository for modeling Kevin's study time in UCSD starting from 2022 as a Freshman. Data changes format through out different quarters, becoming more developed and suitable, so merging and some cleaning is needed at first.

Each quarter's data includes one data frame of all the study/work time data and an text feature data frame for the work conducted:

- One almost fully Timestamp + Numerical data frame (`year_quarter_study`) that records all the *study_time*
- One almost fully Timestamp + Text data frame (`year_quarter_text`) that records the precise *study_subject*

Data currently include:

 1. 2022_fall_study.csv + 2022_fall_text.csv
 2. 2022_winter_study.csv + 2022_winter_text.csv
 3. 2022_spring_study.csv + 2022_spring_text.csv
 4. 2022_summer_study.csv + 2022_summer_text.csv
 5. 2023_fall_study.csv + 2023_fall_text.csv
 6. 2024_winter_study.csv + 2024_winter_text.csv
 7. 2024_spring_study.csv + 2024_spring_text.csv
 8. 2024_summer_study.csv + 2024_summer_text.csv
 9. 2024_fall_study.csv + 2024_fall_text.csv

Currently I did:

- Created a `chating` function where an language model would take all the text in the csv files as embedding and build a personalized search engine.
- Conducted explorative data analysis with numerical data, specifcally timestamp data.
