## Creating A "Chatable" Study Database ðŸ’¬
Data science in practice, I created this manually collected study data for modeling my study time in UCSD since 2022 as a Freshman. I conducted numerous numerical analysis to discover some study habit that I have and analyze when I would be busiest for later quarter's understanding. In addition, I also created `chat` functions with a language model for a personalized search engine.
