# Work Hours Analysis
This is a repository for modeling Kevin's workload/work_hours in UCSD starting from 2022 as a Freshman.

Data changes format through out different quarters, becoming more developed and suitable, so merging and some cleaning is needed at first.

Each quarter's data includes one data frame of all the study/work time data and an text feature data frame for the work conducted:
- One almost fully Timestamp + Numerical data frame
- One almost fully Timestamp + Text data frame
